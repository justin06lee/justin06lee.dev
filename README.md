# sehnsucht.dev

this is my personal dev website. feel free to look around - ill be posting my projects and hobbies here. 

easy to use: go on the website and start browsing. 

dev: its a next.js project with zero backend, so you just have to clone the repo if you want to edit it. no license here use it however you want.
